[two Fortran compilers](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-oneapi-fortran-compiler-release-notes.html):

- Intel Fortran Compiler (`ifx`), a new, LLVM-based compiler
  that comes with full Fortran 2018 support. It also supports the [majority of OpenMP 5.0/5.1](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/fortran-language-and-openmp-features-in-ifx.html) including offload to Intel GPUs. 
  ifx can also offload `do concurrent` to Intel GPUs.
- Intel Fortran Compiler Classic (`ifort`), a mature compiler
  with full Fortran 2018 support, for CPUs only.

Currently the ifx compiler supports Linux and Windows platforms for x86-64 architectures. ifort supports Linux, Windows, and macOS.

*The current version of Intel oneAPI is
[available for free](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html),
and support can be purchased.
Community support is available for the free version at the [Intel Developer forum](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Fortran-Compiler/bd-p/fortran-compiler).
Optionally, you can purchase [Priority Support](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/get-help/priority-support.html) with additional benefits including access to previous versions of ifort and ifx.

<h4> <b> NAG </b></h4>

The latest [NAG Fortran Compiler](https://nag.com/nag-compiler)
release (7.0) has extensive support for legacy and modern Fortran features including parallel programming with coarrays, as well as additional support for programming with OpenMP.

The Compiler also provides significant support for Fortran 2018 (atomic
operations, events and tasks, plus other smaller features), almost all of
Fortran 2008, complete coverage of Fortran 2003, and all of OpenMP 3.1. All
platforms include supporting tools for software development: source file
polishers, dependency generator for module and include files, call-graph
generator, interface builder and a precision unifier.

<h4> <b> NVIDIA</b></h4>

The [NVIDIA HPC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk) C, C++, and Fortran compilers, former [PGI compilers](https://www.pgroup.com/products/index.htm), support GPU acceleration of HPC modeling and simulation applications with standard C++ and Fortran, OpenACC® directives, and CUDA®. GPU-accelerated math libraries maximize performance on common HPC algorithms, and optimized communications libraries enable standards-based multi-GPU and scalable systems programming.

Currently the compiler supports Linux platforms and x86_64, ppc64le and aarch64 architectures.
Community support is available at the [HPC compiler forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/accelerated-computing/hpc-compilers/nvc-nvc-and-nvfortran/313).

<h4> <b> HPE / Cray</b></h4>

The [Cray Compiling Environment (CCE)](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-cray-programming-environment/home/)
is the cornerstone innovation of Cray's adaptive computing paradigm. CCE builds
on a well-developed and sophisticated Cray technology base that identifies
regions of computation that are either sequential scalar, vector parallel or
highly multithreaded. It includes optimizing compilers that automatically
